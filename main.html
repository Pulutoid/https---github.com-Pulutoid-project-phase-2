          <span class="body">

            I've got a great idea for a business - an escape room! People would come in and have to solve puzzles and
            riddles to get out. It would be so much fun and challenging. I think it would appeal to a lot of people who
            like games and mysteries. I already have some themes in mind, like a haunted house, a pirate ship, a space
            station, and a bank heist. Each room would have different props and clues, and a timer to add some pressure.
            The customers would have to work together as a team to find the way out. I think it would be a great way to
            make money and entertain people. I just need to find a suitable location and some investors to make it
            happen. I'm really excited about this idea and I hope it becomes a reality soon.

            I just had dinner at new restaurant nearby, and it was amazing!
            The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, and the food was
            delicious...
