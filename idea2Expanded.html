                    I've got a great idea for a business - an escape room! People would come in and have to solve
                    puzzles and riddles to get out. It would be so much fun and challenging. I think it would appeal to
                    a lot of people who like games and mysteries. I already have some themes in mind, like a haunted
                    house, a pirate ship, a space station, and a bank heist. Each room would have different props and
                    clues, and a timer to add some pressure. The customers would have to work together as a team to find
                    the way out. I think it would be a great way to make money and entertain people. I just need to find
                    a suitable location and some investors to make it happen. I'm really excited about this idea and I
                    hope it becomes a reality soon.
